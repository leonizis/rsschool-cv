## About me

Since childhood, I have been attracted to computers. Even at school, I was easily able to do computer science. Always the first to solve the tasks.
But fate chose a slightly different path. In addition to computer science, I was also good at music, in particular playing the accordion.
I studied this for a long time, but the craving for a computer did not fade away. By the will of fate, I had to make an online store on my own, I did it on OpenCart.
Next, I got acquainted with WordPress. But there was always not enough knowledge, so I decided to learn a programming language. Completed courses in Python (basic).
But I realized that Front-End development is still closer to me. I studied basic HTML, CSS, JS basic. And now I'm taking a Java Script/Front-End course at RS School.


## My skills
* Python (basis)
* HTML/CSS/JS (basis)
* OpenCart/WordPress

## Code example:
```
function testFactorial(a) {
    var x = 1;
    let total = 1;
    while (total < a + 1){
        x = total * x
        total++
    }
    return x;
}
```
